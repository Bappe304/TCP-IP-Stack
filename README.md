# TCP-IP-Stack
## Overview
This project is a custom implementation of the TCP/IP stack, designed to emulate networking operations at various layers. It aims to provide fundamental networking functionalities such as packet processing and routing, focusing on the TCP/IP model.

## Status
**Note:** This project is currently under development. The L2/L3 layers are still in progress, and additional features will be added over time.
STAY TUNED!
## Contents
- **CommandParser**: Manages command-line input parsing for network commands.
- **net.c / net.h**: Contains networking functions, such as packet sending and receiving.
- **topologies.c**: Defines network topologies used for testing and simulations.
- **utils.c / utils.h**: Utility functions to support networking operations.
  
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bappe304/TCP-IP-Stack.git
   ```
2. Compile the code using the `makefile`.
3. Run `testapp.c` to execute test cases for the network stack.
